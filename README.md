# Sudoko-solver
This project is a C++ implementation of a Sudoku solver. It provides an efficient solution for solving Sudoku puzzles using the backtracking algorithm. The program takes an input grid (partially filled Sudoku puzzle) and attempts to complete the grid by filling in the missing numbers while adhering to Sudoku rules.
Features:

Solves any 9x9 Sudoku puzzle.
Uses a backtracking algorithm for efficient problem-solving.
Validates the input grid to ensure it adheres to Sudoku rules.
Command-line interface for easy input and output.
How to Use:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Compile the code using any C++ compiler.
Run the program and input the Sudoku grid.
Future Enhancements:

Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for interactive use.
Extend support for different grid sizes.
Tech Stack:

Programming Language: C++
Contribution Guidelines:
Feel free to contribute by raising issues or submitting pull requests to improve the code or add new features.
